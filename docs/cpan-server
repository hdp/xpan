We need an extensible framework for presenting CPAN indexes over http.

The base package can be a skeleton with the right hooks for serving /modules
and /authors.  We'll want to provide a role that all models must consume.
CPAN::Whatever::OnDisk can be the basic model (using CPAN::Faker), and maybe a
trivial in-memory-only model too.
