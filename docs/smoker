We need a standalone smoker. 

The smoker's API is this:

GIVEN: (a) a set of modules to have installed (b) a set of dists to test
THEN: (a) test them (b) report back

It's important that we try to ensure that (Given(a)) is treated as "and nothing
else, with some exceptions maybe" (like, maybe, local::lib).  The smoker's job
is not to figure out extra dependencies for the listed dists -- all
dependencies should already be included in (b), since we want to explicitly
list the entire potential change.

Useful targets for this functionality (standalone) are Moose and Catalyst, two
projects that have a large ecosystem of plugins and extensions.  (For
standalone operation, the "set of modules to have installed" would probably
just be "the current set of installed modules".)

When we want to glue this smoker to XPAN, its most important job is:

* you tell it "Is it okay to upgrade pinset X to pinset Y's contents?"
* it ensures that it is going to run things in Y's environment
* it runs the tests for everything downstream-affected by the delta(X,Y)
* it returns a grade and a bunch of TAP archives

the smoker should really be a job queue thingie, and it would be awesome to be
able to check on its status: "How's that smoke going?" // "5 dists to go, all
green so far!"
